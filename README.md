# DanDaDan Startpage

![startpage preview](./preview.png)

A simple startpage, iterating over multiple images from the DanDaDan opening.

On each reload, a random variant will be displayed.
If you always want to see the same variant, you can pass one in `src/scripts/index.js`.

You can also modify the bookmarks in `src/scripts/index.js`.
